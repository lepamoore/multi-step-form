- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Since this is my first React App i just noticed shortly before i finished the project that i barely used the lifecycle methods of react.
The lifecycle methods wouldÂ´ve been so helpful and i would've managed some tasks much faster than i did without them. 
I won't forget them so fast again...

### Continued development

Like i mentioned above i want to include the lifecycle methods more into my react projects.
